## Overview

Video 3x Speed gives every standard HTML5 video a focused speed control layer. It defaults to `3x`, keeps the chosen speed when pages try to reset playback rate, and includes a compact toolbar popup for quick adjustments.

The extension is intentionally small: no analytics, no remote code, no account system, and no background service doing extra work.

## Highlights

| Capability | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Fast by default | New videos are set to `3x` automatically. |
| Persistent control | If a page resets playback speed, the extension applies your selected speed again. |
| Toolbar popup | Pause the extension or switch between preset speeds in one click. |
| Fine adjustment | Use the slider to choose any speed from `0.25x` to `5x`. |
| Privacy-first | Stores only the enable state and selected speed through Chrome storage. |

## Interface

</p>

The popup is designed to stay quiet and task-focused: one switch, one speed value, one slider, and four common presets.
